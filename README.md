# Leaders & Contributors Dashboard (Stacks)

A full-featured analytics and activity dashboard built on the **Stacks blockchain**, designed to help project builders, contributors, and ecosystem participants track wallet activity, contributions, and on-chain engagement across Stacks. The application supports modern wallet connectivity, real-time data fetching, and a mobile-first user experience.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User opens the dashboard
2. Wallet connect modal is triggered
3. User selects a wallet (desktop or mobile)
4. Wallet address is detected securely
5. Public APIs are queried for activity data
6. Data is aggregated into a clean dashboard view

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This is a fully client-side application and can be deployed on:
- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**
- **GitHub Pages**

No environment variables or backend services are required for basic functionality.

## 🔐 WalletConnect Configuration

This project uses a WalletConnect-style authentication flow built on the Stacks Connect SDK, enabling seamless wallet connections across desktop and mobile environments.

### Supported Wallets
- Leather
- Xverse

Both wallets support:
- Desktop browser extensions
- Mobile deep linking
- QR-based connection flows

---

### Required Configuration

#### 1. App Metadata

Your app must expose valid metadata:

```ts
const appConfig = {
  name: "Leaders & Contributors Dashboard",
  icon: "https://your-domain.com/icon.png",
};
```

**Requirements**
- Icon size: **512×512**
- Publicly accessible
- HTTPS only

---

#### 2. Wallet Connection Setup

```ts
import { showConnect } from "@stacks/connect";

showConnect({
  appDetails: appConfig,
  onFinish: ({ userSession }) => {
    // wallet connected
  },
  onCancel: () => {
    // user closed modal
  },
});
```

This flow:
- Displays a multi-wallet selector
- Handles QR codes automatically
- Uses deep links on mobile
- Establishes a secure session

---

#### 3. Network Configuration

```ts
import { StacksMainnet } from "@stacks/network";

const network = new StacksMainnet();
```

Use testnet explicitly for local development when needed.

## 📱 Mobile Wallet Troubleshooting

### ❌ Wallet Won’t Connect on Mobile

**Causes**
- App not served over HTTPS
- Missing or invalid app icon
- Unsupported browser

**Fix**
- Deploy with HTTPS
- Ensure `/public/icon.png` loads
- Use Chrome or Safari

---

### ❌ “Couldn’t Connect” Error

**Causes**
- Wallet not installed
- Conflicting wallet providers
- Deprecated APIs

**Fix**
- Avoid `window.web3`
- Do not redefine wallet providers
- Use supported wallet SDKs only

---

### ❌ QR Works on Desktop but Not Mobile

**Expected Behavior**
- Desktop → QR modal
- Mobile → Deep link to wallet app

**Fix**
- Open site in mobile browser
- Install wallet app
- Avoid in-app browsers (Twitter, Telegram)

---

### ❌ No STX Balance or Price Showing

Wallet connection only provides:
- Wallet address
- Authentication session

You must explicitly fetch:
- Balances from Stacks API
- Prices from an external indexer or API

---

### ❌ SSL / Network Errors

Errors like:
```
ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
```

**Fix**
- Use a valid SSL certificate
- Avoid mixed HTTP/HTTPS content
- Confirm APIs support HTTPS

---

### Debug Checklist

Before reporting an issue:
- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- ✅ Icon accessible
- ✅ Wallet installed
- ✅ Correct network selected
- ✅ No deprecated provider usage
- ✅ Browser-based testing

---
